The following files contains copied material from Axel Isaksson & F Lundevall
* // core_stubs.c //
  All code is copied, original file name: stubs.c
  Used for initialization of the main Digilent 'chipKit™' hardware.

* // Makefile //
  All code is copied
  Used for compiling C and Assembly files with the MCB32 compiler and transferring
  the information to the Digilent 'chipKit™' hardware.

* // config_chipkit.c // 
  All code is copied, the origin of the code is from a file called 'mipslabfunc.c'
  Used for initialization of the main Digilent 'chipKit™' hardware.

* // immuno.h //
  Contains copied headers for displaying string with credits and highscore after
  game over, Only the first set of headers are copied. Copies origin from 'mipslab.h'
  provided by Axel Isaksson, F Lundevall and KTH.

* // config_oled.c //
  The code in this file is not copied, with the exception of 3 sparesly used functions
  referred to in the file. NOTE However, that the other code is inspired by the display
  configuration file 'mipslabfunc.c' provided by Axel Isaksson, F Lundevall and 
  KTH. The file is primarily based on the Digilent 'chipKIT™' Basic I/O Shield™
  Reference Manual and SOLOMON SYSTECH OLED Common Driver information 'SSD1306'.

* // assets_main.c //
  Only the fist two buffers in this file, the textbuffer and the font buffer, are copied
